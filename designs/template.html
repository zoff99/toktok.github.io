        <p>One sentence explaining what the proposal is about.</p>

<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>

<p>What are we doing? Why are we doing this? What are the goals? What are
NON-goals? This section explains the project to someone not familiar with
your project.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Related work in the TokTok or Tox projects? What similar projects exist? Links
to external documents/wikipedia? Nothing about design/requirements here, just
background.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>Who are the customers for the solution? What are their needs? What is the
problem space? This section estimates scale requirements. How much data needs
to be stored/processed? What kind of data? What about latency/throughput/etc
network requirements? How about growth?</p>

<h2 id="design-ideas">Design Ideas</h2>

<p>Overview of the design. If you have multiple viable ideas, list them all with
pros and cons. Do not include code, only type signatures and explanations. Use
diagrams if necessary. Major structural elements go here. Which existing
technologies will be used? Which components will you write? How do they
integrate? How will others integrate with them? What scaling parameters need to
be considered most prominently? How will the product be rolled out to users?
Implementation strategies go here, implementation does not.</p>

<h2 id="alternatives-considered">Alternatives Considered</h2>

<p>Describe alternatives to the design. Where choices within the design were made,
write those choices inline in the document. This section contains completely
different approaches, their pros and cons, and the reason for not choosing
them. Also include “doing nothing” as one alternative.</p>
